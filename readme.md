Calculator App

// Notes
- main-1.js Result at 3.5hrs (some bugs)
- main-2.js +3hrs, Calculations work as intended (current version used in the html)
- main-3.js +3hrs, Additional work looking into keyboard only functionality. 


// Process & Timeline
- HTML, CSS (SCSS) setup 1hr.
- JS 2hrs, basic functionality achieved. (not complete, bugs)
- Additional 3hr, core functionality works. (Bug fixes, refactoring etc)


// Thinking
- Setup HTML / SCSS to have something to work with. (at least basic css)
- Some considerations given to HTML Tab order, decided to split the keypad into two separate groupings; Numbers(+ functions) vs Operations.
- (Thinking about a possible keyboard shortcut to cycle focus between the groups)

- JS logic brainstorm, thinking about possible approaches before coding anything.
- Create basic setup and functionality before working on details.
- Building on the logic, test it out, fix bugs add features as time allows.


// Challenges
- Figuring out the initial approach i.e. what variables / functions are needed.
- Then mostly understanding the logic behind allowing separate calculations to be made vs chaining calculations together.


// Mistakes
- Initially set the display as an input field to type out calculations. Added unnecessary complexity for no gain.
- Lost time struggling to work with only firstNumber & secondNumber variables, ended up adding workingNumber & sum variables.
